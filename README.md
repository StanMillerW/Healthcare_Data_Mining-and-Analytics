# Predictive-Analytics-for-Risk-Profiling-of-Covid-19-Patients
## Background

Covid has prompted changes in people's daily lives. The entire world has seen a significant threat this pandemic posed to people. 
Thus, many countries have been encouraging people to stay at home. However, upon reopening, what additional effort should the government take and what lessons 
can we obtain from patients to identify most at-risk populations?
Thus, in this project, I will build predictive models based on one synthetic database to identify the at-risk population as what characteristics a patient may have. Hopefully, the results and the research approach could be applied to other studies.

## Analytic approach
- Create analytic file out of the clinical data
- Build predictive models and pick up the model with the best performance and efficiency
- Visualize variables using text mining (word cloud) and bar charts
- Explain some of the results behind the model
